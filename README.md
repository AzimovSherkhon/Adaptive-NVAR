# Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression (Adaptive NVAR)
## This reposity contains the code of the paper "Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series"

## Author: Azimov Sherkhon

We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP). 
The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure.
Initial experiments on chaotic systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation frequency.
